                    I have four children at home, so never a dull catastrophy which is why I came to galvanize for a quiet place to learn. Using headphones to drown out area noise with soothing music. I carry snacks to keep me from wondering about food and not to worry about hunger, and coffee I use to signal break times. Break times gets me moving and experiencing a new place that isn't my laptop.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Speaking of laptops. I minimize or close any tabs or programs that do not provide any use in learning about a subject I want to learn about. Close out of any message boards or turn off notifications. Lastly, I will put my phone on vibrate and usually on a napkin or notepad (if notepad not in use) to soften the vibrations.

                    Started out watching YouTube videos on CSS Grid then decided to follow along with a couple of the videos. Still using the command line to create directories and files then opening atom to work on CSS Grids I tooled along with the speaker and their slides.  Had to pause the video mostly to get the grid to work like it did in the lecture by using cheat sheets like the one CSS Tricks has on their site. I finished the video and recreated the example they used. Suprised I was that I was able
                    to duplicate the example and to know basically how it all worked.

                    Finding a quiet location having my snacks and prepping the laptop worked well for me. The one thing I will change is to add a real timer versus using coffee to judge breaks. Many times when I should have gone on break I dug in even deeper on trying to make a CSS rule to work. Once I reached for the coffee and it was ice cold I knew I waited too long for a break.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I really felt I got a lot out of following a video while trying to recreate their examples.  Troubleshooting things that did not match the example and the little successes really kept me engaged. Most videos I watch will be mandatory participation.

                    Ranger is a console file manager that operates similarly to Finder on a Mac. Killer Kyle wants us to be experienced coders. Kyle aided us in getting ranger on our workstations, and now we can be super-coders. Ranger can be implemented at any time while
                    in the command line to assist your ability to traverse your files.

                    Speed to a workflow comes up over and over. Anything we can do to speed up workflow will always work in our favor. While in Ranger I created Ranger-tabs with <code>control + n</code> and using TAB cycles through the Ranger-tabs you make. Got to many tabs you say? No worries, just use <code>alt + number of tab</code> to jump right to tab of choice. Done with a tab?
                    <code>control + w</code> will delete the unwanted tab. You can use the arrow keys or VIM keys (h, j, k, l) to move around in Ranger. Want to rename a file? No problem! Try <code>c + w</code> while on the file you want to rename and change the name then hit <code>return/enter</code>. Get a little wanky and need to abort the name change just use <code>control + c</code> to walk away.

                <p>
                    We just scratched the surface of Ranger, but it is a start. Kyle is pushing us to become more than the average user. Guessing for us to stand out in the crowd of other developer pools looking for jobs. When using ranger, I can search files right from my command line speeding up my ability to accomplish tasks on a project.

                    Let us start off with setting the stage. Opening up a new tab to use ranger is ok to do. Not necessary since every time you use Ranger it starts off at the home directory. Still a quick way to find a location far far away from where you are. Tons better than opening Mac's Finder, tabbing through a maze of directories. Do not fear for Ranger is near. I got the basics down in ranger to search and move into a file, and that's about it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Plenty to learn and try in ranger (I think), but so far it seems well worth the time. Wonder why so many g-students are not using ranger? So it seems like that anyway. Even after being shown ranger a few students chose not to use ranger. Maybe its something they will learn later just not now. Something I found out from Marlena, class TA, is how using ranger stops any.DS files from cluttering up your git files. When using Finder, found on Macs, a .DS file generated that shows information on that data. Something fresh for some specific purpose, but not so much for updating your repository. Anyway, I feel like my cool meter jumped another notch. Wow, so many cool references! Coding is just cool. Now to figure out how to look good at being so
                    cool.

                    When possible I try to find a work area that is quiet without bright lights. Using headphones for ambient music playing to cover some outside noises helps with distractions. Like having snacks to curb hunger and aimlessly wandering the street for food.
                    Before jumping into the subject I want to learn I will clear any miscellaneous tabs and shut-down or turn off any application notifications.

                    During class an instruction on downloading http-server got me started. To install go to your command line and input <code>&nbsp;npm install http-server -g&nbsp;</code> and your all set. You can use Mac's Finder, but I use the command line to go to the project folder to
                    run a server to display my project. While in the project folder I input in the command line <code>&nbsp;http-server&nbsp;</code>. I went to different project folders to run the http-server to get the hang of deploying my projects.

                    Having a clean work area and snacks at my side helped me stay working with less wandering. Next time I will use a timer to set breaks. Worked way too long without breaks. Think I will use a cup of coffee as a break timer. Every time I need more coffee
                    I will take my time and not rush to the laptop. Headphones for ambient music is good and next time I will choose my music more carefully. Having music that you want to engage in keeps me focused on the wrong thing. I will be adding
                    the coffee timer and choose different music for next time.
