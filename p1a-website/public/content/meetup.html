                <p>
                    Jim works for Captain U. Captain U is a company that builds apps for Sports teams and universities. Ember.js is how Captain U uses to create their apps. Jim went to Turing three years ago and loves his new profession in coding.

                <h3>What I Learned</h3>
                <p>
                    Meet-up went over GraphQL more so than Ember.js. GraphQL allows to search data you want without getting data you don't want. Facebook started using GraphQL in 2015. One cool thing I learned was about a skeleton-UI. The skeleton.UI creates a phantom (wireframe)
                    image of the app loading to prime the user's experience of the app.
                </p>
                <h3>Questions I Have</h3>
                <p>
                    Can you use the skeleton.UI for any project? Is GraphQL only for Ember.js or used with any programme?

                <p>
                    Introduced myself to Ben and Devon who works for a company called Gigabyte. Thier company used to use Ember.js and recently put all their effort into Vue.js. Ben and Devon wished they made the switch a year ago, as they explained that they got tired of
                    doing a lot of work in Ember.js to get a little reward.
                </p>
                <h3>What I Learned</h3>
                <p>
                    Vue is a js framework that is easy to adopt and integrates with other projects. Vue.js renders data, content, to the DOM (document object model), and usually with Bulma.io a CSS framework based on Flexbox. An MIT license for Vue.js observed for the use
                    of Vue.js. Although I have no experience with Vue.js to substantiate anything I am writing. So, don't take my word for it. Damian Dulisz of Monterail stated, "finally, I seemed to have found the grail of frameworks â€” cutting-edge,
                    flexible, and simply beautiful both in terms of internal architecture as well as API." I know that based on the project needs will dictate one framework over another. It is best to know more than one and preferably each framework you
                    learn to have some overlap but can accomplish different tasks. MIT license.
                </p>
                <h3>Questions I Have</h3>
                <p>
                    Can Vue.js be integrated into other frameworks? Can other frameworks be integrated into Vue.js?

                    James the host worked for a company called eMersive, and he is an Engineer. Triston, an Engineer, with an eagerness to unload tons of information beyond my understanding and Perry also worked at eMersive. Perry worked on cat-log's hunting down errors
                    in code. When I asked Triston what he did at the company he stated, "You can call me a Jr-Engineer that works on anything they give me." Great folks and is shows the passion they have for what they do.
                </p>
                <h3>What I Learned</h3>
                <p>
                    Android is not a program as I first thought. Andriod is an operating system that is a distribution of Linux. Security system that Android uses is SE Linux also known as Security Enhance Linux. eMersive showed how they use Java and C++ and use JIT (just-in-time)
                    that compiles during execution of the two codes to work together. eMersive uses Windows Pc and they all hate it.
                </p>
                <h3>Questions I Have</h3>
                <p>
                    Can Android OS be duel booted onto a Mac laptop? Can you build an application that can be served on both Android and Mac?
